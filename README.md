# House-Prices-Prediction

This project was completed for my class STT 3795 - Theoretical Foundations of Data Science. As a team of 3, we participated in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) Kaggle competition and achieved a rank of 340/9515 (top 4%). Please use [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/San-Bed/House-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/main.ipynb) link if you want to view `main.ipynb`, as GitHub often has troubles rendering `.ipynb` files.

## Installation

Start by cloning the repository and installing all required packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/sandrine-bedard/House-Prices-Prediction
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt 
```

Then, you should be able to run `main.ipynb`. Some comments and graphs are available directly in the notebook. Check [full_report.pdf](https://github.com/San-Bed/House-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/full_report.pdf) for more information.

## Support

If you run through any trouble with the installation, please contact me at [sandrine.bedard@icloud.com](mailto:sandrine.bedard@icloud.com]).

## Acknowledgment
